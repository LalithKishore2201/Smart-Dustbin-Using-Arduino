# Smart-Dustbin-Using-Arduino-Ultrasonic-Sensor-And-Servo-Motor
In this project smart dustbin is built on a microcontroller based platform Arduino Uno board which is interfaced with the Servo motor and ultrasonic sensor. Ultrasonic sensor is placed at the top of the dustbin which will measure the stature of the dustbin.

# OBJECTIVE
To Design and build a prototype for an automatic open dustbin that can automatically open the lid when it detects the people who want to throw out their trash. It also can detect the level of the trash that inside the dustbin.  Arduino will be programmed in such a way that when someone comes in front of the dustbin, the servo motor will come in action and open the lid
for the person to put the waste material into the dustbin.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE
The dustbin opens automatically when it receives the signal and closes its hatch. Also the dustbin consists of a level sensing ultrasonic sensor that constantly measures the level of garbage in the bin and automatically detects if it is about to fill up.
